## Introduction

---

## Course overview
## &#173;

* In this course we will:
    * Start from an existing Scala (2.13)/[Akka Typed](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/actors.html#module-info) (2.6) based application
    * Apply features introduced in the Scala language as part of the Scala 3 project
### &#173;
* The objective is to illustrate how these new features:
    * Bring added value and can simplify Scala code
    * Remove some of the inconsistencies or warts from the Scala 2 language

---

## Course prerequisites
## &#173;

* The participants should have practical experience with the Scala 2 language
* The course has a number of exercises and each student should have a computer with the following installed:
    * JDK 11 (e.g. [AdoptOpenJDK 11](adoptopenjdk.net))
    * [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html)
    * An editor or IDE of your choice configured to work with Scala 3 code
        * Possible options are:
            * [Metals](scalameta.org) with your client of choice ([Visual Code Studio](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode.html), [Vim](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vim.html), etcâ€¦)
            * [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the Scala plugin installed and [configured to use the nightly build](https://blog.jetbrains.com/scala/2020/03/17/scala-3-support-in-intellij-scala-plugin/)
* Optionally install the Scala 3 compiler and Scala 3 REPL
    * This can be done using Coursier:
        * *`cs install scalac:3.3.0`*
        * *`cs install scala:3.3.0`*

## Preparing for the exercises
## &#173;

* Download the student-ready version of the exercises [here](https://github.com/lunatech-labs/lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course/releases)
* Unzip the downloaded artefact and *`cd`* into the *`lunatech-scala-2-to-scala3-course`* folder
    * This folder contains an *`sbt`* project that contains all the exercises
* Start an *`sbt`* session in the root folder
* Load the project into your favourite development environment (IDE)

## Student exercise repository functionality
## &#173;

- We use the *`cmtc`* command from the command line to navigate the course.
