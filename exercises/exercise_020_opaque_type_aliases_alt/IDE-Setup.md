# Moving Forward from Scala 2 to Scala 3

### Installing an IDE

We recommend to use either IntelliJ with the Scala language plugin, or Visual Code
Studio with the Metals extension installed.

If you haven't installed an IDE that support the Scala Language, install either
IntelliJ or VSCode by following the instructions linked in the following sections.

> Note: in our experience, VSCode with the Metals extension definitely has an edge on the
> IntelliJ IDE for Scala Worksheet support.

#### Installing IntelliJ with the Scala Language Plugin

* [Install the IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html#standalone) (Community or Ultimate edition)
    * [Install the Scala Language](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html)

#### Installing Visual Code Studio with the Metals extension

* [Install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
    * [Install the Visual Code Studio Metals extension](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode/)

### Other Scala source editors

There are plenty of other options for Source Code editing. For example, Metals supports Vim, Sublime Text and Emacs. For more information, have a look at the [Text Editors section](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs) in the Metals Documentation
