# Initial State

## Documentation

You may want to have look at the [Scala Language website](https://www3.scala-lang.org)
and bookmark it in your favourite browser.

It has a number of links among which:

- The [Scala 3 Language Reference](https://docs3.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference).
- The [Scala API documentation](https://docs3.scala-lang.org/api/all.html) for every version of Scala.
- The [Scala 3 Book](https://docs3.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/introduction.html) which
  gives you a concise introduction to all things Scala 3.

## An Akka Typed/Scala based Sudoku Solver

## Background

This application, written in Scala 2, implements an Akka Typed/Scala
based Sudoku Solver that is composed of 29 actors.

The application will also start up an instance of a Sudoku problem generator
that continuously cycles through a series of Sudoko problems at a configurable
rate, tunable via configuration.

The course consists of a series of exercises in which you change the source code to leverage Scala 3 specific features. The application comes with tests that are basically the same across all exercises. The tests should pass at every stage: if they don't, you've broken something and you will need to fix it.

We will first show you how to test and run the application.


## Steps

- The project uses sbt as build tool. Have a look at the build definition
  in the `code/build.sbt` file to figure out what version of Scala it is
  using. The full build definition is composed of `code/build.sbt` and
  `code/project/Build.scala`. Other than inspecting the build definition,
  is there another way to find out which Scala version is used?

- In the project's `code` folder, start an `sbt` session.

- Compile the main code and the test code by respectively running the
  `compile` and `Test/compile` commands from the `sbt` prompt.
  Look for compilation warnings and fix these so that compilation no longer
  produces any warning(s).

- Run the provided tests by executing the `test` command from the `sbt` prompt
  You should see output similar to the following:

- Run the Sodukosolver by executing the `runSolver` command from the `sbt` prompt.

- Note that you can stop the application by hitting `Return` in the sbt session.

- Observe sudoku solver in action: you should see the following output:

```scala
man [e] > Scala 2 to Scala 3 > sudoku solver initial state > runSolver

```

- You can control the rate at which the Sudoku problem generator sends
  problems by tweaking the setting `sudoku-solver.problem-sender.send-interval`
  in the `sudokusolver.conf` configuration file.

## Source code formatting & Markdown viewer in IntelliJ


### Source code formatting

[scalafmt](https://github.com/scalameta/scalafmt) based source code formatting is
in place in this project. scalafmt supports both Scala 2 and Scala 3. You can
[re]format the code by running `scalafmtAll` from the sbt prompt. As we switch from
Scala 2 to Scala 3, you need to make sure that a matching scalafmt configuration is
in place.

### Next steps

After successfully completing the tasks in this exercise, move to the next one by
running the `cmtc next-exercise` from the command line.

### Markdown viewer in IntelliJ IDEA

The font size can be a bit too small for the taste of some people. You can change the
Markdown zoom setting in IntelliJ by pasting the following CSS snippet in the
markdown setting in _" Settings" -> "Languages & Frameworks" -> "Custom CSS -> CSS rules"_ and adjust the font-size setting to your liking:

```
body {
  font-size: 120% !important;
}
```
